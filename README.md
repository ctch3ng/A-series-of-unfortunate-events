This repository is dedicated to the study of the failure rate in a multi-stage manufacturing process

### Case 1: Fail without Jamming

Consider a manufacturing process with *n* stages connected in series. Let *P<sub>i</sub>* be the probability for the *i*-th stage to generate a faulty part. 

Probability for having a faulty part: 
    1-Prob (not having a single faulty part for all *n* stages)
