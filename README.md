This repository is dedicated to the study of the failure rate in a multi-stage manufacturing process

### Case 1: Fail without Jamming

Consider a manufacturing process with *n* stages connected in series. Let *P_<sub>i</sub>* be the probability for the *i*-stage to generate a faulty part. 

Probability for having a faulty part: 
    1-Prob(not having faulty part for all *n* stages) 
=>  1-(1-$$P_i$$)
